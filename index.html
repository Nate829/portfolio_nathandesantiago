       <p>This web portfoilo includes examples of my work in Mr. Lanus' Web
         Design class. It also includes my reflections (below) on what I
         learned in each unit of the course.</p>

       <h2> Unit 1: HTML </h2>
       <p><strong><li> What do you think are the most important vocabulary terms (or key concepts)
         in this unit? What do you think that they mean?</p></strong></li>
        <ul> I think that the most important vocabulary terms are : tags, DOCTYPE, ul, ol, h1, head, and etc.They are used to create links,
          different fonts, add text, and many other different tags.</ul>
       <p><strong><li> What do you think are the most important skills that you learned in this unit of study?</p></strong></li>
        <ul> I learned how colors play an important part in the way a website can turn out, and how to use tags like
          < p >, < h1 >, < main >, and many more.</ul>
       <p><strong><li> In what ways have you gotten better at this kind of work?</p></strong></li>
        <ul> I've learned about how to use tags, and how they work.I also learn how to use html and
          how to start a website from scratch.</ul>
       <p><strong><li> In what ways do you think you need to improve?</p><strong></li>
        <ul> I need to have more patience and creative thinking when it comes to web design, because this class requires
          a lot of patience and thinking.</ul>
       <p><strong><li> What problems did you encounter while you were working on this piece? How did you solve them?</p></strong></li>
        <ul> I don't really run into that much problems. It's more of a bad habit, I would forget to add the end dash on
          almost every end tag.</ul>
       <p><strong><li> What was especially satisfying to you about either the process or the finished product?</p></strong></li>
        <ul> I really like the finished product because it looks like an actual website and that's the look I was going for.</ul>
       <p><strong><li> If you were the teacher, what comments would you make about this piece?</p></strong></li>
        <ul> Nothing, I would admire this work and I just would say “This piece is beautiful.”</ul>







       <h2>Unit 2: Color & CSS</h2>
      <p><strong><li>What do you think are the most important vocabulary terms (or key concepts) in this unit? What do you think that they mean?
</p></strong></li>
       <ul> The most important vocabulary terms (or key concepts) in this unit is basically styles and CSS. Which means Cascading Style Sheets.</ul>
      <p><strong><li>What do you think are the most important skills that you learned in this unit of study?</p></strong></li>
       <ul>The most important skills that learned in this unit is how to add styles and use CSS.</ul>
         <p><strong><li> In what ways have you gotten better at this kind of work?</p></strong></li>
       <ul> I gotten in CSS by understabding this Unit more. I think CSS is very easy to understand than Unit 1: HTML. </ul>
         <p><strong><li> In what ways do you think you need to improve? </p></strong></li>
       <ul> I need to improve by spending some more time with HTML and CSS> </ul>
         <p><strong><li> What problems did you encounter while you were working on this piece? How did you solve them? </p></strong></li>
       <ul> Some promblems when encounter is if you forget one little thing your computer won't put what you wanted to add. Always make sure you spell
         correctly. </ul>
         <p><strong><li> What was especially satisfying to you about either the process or the finished product?  </p></strong></li>
       <ul> What is satisfying about the process is that it looks like how I wanted to look. </ul>
        <p><strong><li> If you were the teacher, what comments would you make about this piece? </p></strong></li>
       <ul> I would say to the student is that "he is on the righ track. Good work." </ul>
